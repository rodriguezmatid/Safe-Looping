## üìù **Leverage & Liquidations: The DeFi Dance-Off**

DeFi investors are often tempted by the high returns of leveraging their positions by using looping strategies but are equally exposed to the threat of liquidations in a downturn market. 

This portrays the constant interplay between leveraging for higher gains and the threat of liquidation. In a dance-off, participants try to outperform each other with their moves. Similarly, investors are trying to outmaneuver the market by leveraging their positions for profit while avoiding the 'missteps' that lead to liquidation.

<br>

> ***üß† The challenge lies in mastering these strategies to maximize gains while safeguarding against the volatile dips of the market.***

<br>

And this delicate balance is at the heart of the issues we are tackling.

SafeLooping's mission is to assist Defi investors in the path to sustainable investment by **calculating the optimal looping lever (leverage rate) for an expected weekly price variation**, by ensuring that profits don't come at the cost of security through an **expected return model that penalizes liquidation risk by leverage rate**.

<br>

## **Context**

In the volatile world of DeFi, investors chase high returns, often embracing excessive risks. 


> üí° A promising yet complex strategy that has emerged within this context is the use of "looping strategies." These strategies involve **reinvesting borrowed assets back into lending platforms to create a leverage loop**, amplifying the potential returns on the initial capital.


Amidst rising bullish sentiment, over-optimism leads to over-leverage, setting the stage for familiar pitfalls.

> 
**Lending markets**, crucial in this leverage play, facilitate strategies that magnify returns through **deposit and borrow _"loops"_**.

 However, the allure of these looping strategies comes with heightened risks of liquidation.

## Problem

The central problem this model aim to address is:

> ***What is the optimal looping strategy that maximizes expected returns while mitigating the risk of liquidation?***

And this problem has mainly two rationales:

1. **Maximizing Returns:**
    - The efficient use of looping strategies can significantly increase the gains of DeFi participants. 
2. **Minimizing Liquidation Risk:**
    - Pursuing higher returns inherently involves greater risks, particularly in a market known for its volatility where collateral values can plummet rapidly. 
    
 The critical element is **identifying the optimal number of loops to achieve maximum yield if price prediction over a period is bullish, without getting liquidated** by market volatility while position is opened.

### **Why Is This Problem Worth Solving?**

Addressing this problem is important for several reasons:

- **Democratizing Access to Advanced DeFi Strategies & Leverage Risk**
    - By simplifying and automating the execution of analysis for looping strategies, this model aims to ***make advanced yield optimization techniques accessible to a broader audience***, not just to sophisticated or institutional investors with the resources and expertise to navigate these complexities with complex quant models.
    - By showcasing liquidation ocurrence probability, ***we aim to educate people to take more responsible financial decisions***. 
    
    <br>

- **Fostering Innovation in Financial Engineering:**
    - The development of a looping strategy optimization model represents a leap forward in financial engineering within the blockchain space. It showcases the potential for innovative algorithms and mathematical models to solve complex financial challenges, paving the way for future breakthroughs in DeFi finance.
